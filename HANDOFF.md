## Current status (2026-08-01, Claude)

**✅ RESOLVED 2026-08-01 ~18:45 UTC — app is back up.** Billing relinked to
`tafsir-simplified-6b262` (freed a slot by unlinking `tafsir-sandbox` per Ahmed's
instruction; billing account allows max 3 linked projects). Verified live:
`POST /tafsir` 2:255 → 200 (cache hit) and 67:2 → 200 in 17.5s (fresh Gemini
generation, clean structured JSON, no extraction fallback). Historical record of
the outage below.

**App was DOWN July 25 – Aug 1; root cause identified and fixed.**

- Both Cloud Run services are healthy and serving (`tafsir-backend`, `tafsir-frontend`,
  project `tafsir-simplified`, us-central1).
- Every tafsir query fails with `"Verse X not found"` because verse text lives in
  Firestore (project `tafsir-simplified-6b262`, DB `tafsir-db`) and that project has
  **no billing account linked** → all Firestore calls return
  `403 This API method requires billing to be enabled`.
- **It is NOT the Gemini model.** `gemini-2.5-flash` (deployed) works until Oct 16–20,
  2026. The user's report of "model deprecated" was a reasonable but wrong guess.

### ⚡ P0 — the one command that brings the app back (human must run/approve)

```bash
gcloud billing projects link tafsir-simplified-6b262 --billing-account=0152F9-4F49EC-74C075
```

Then verify (see checklist in AI.md). No redeploy needed — the running containers will
start succeeding as soon as billing propagates (minutes).

Cause identified from audit logs: `DisableResourceBilling` on 2026-07-25T20:22Z by
ahmedsheik123@gmail.com — ~3 min after the "Life OS" project was created on the same
billing account. Likely the billing account's linked-project quota forced an unlink
(or it was unlinked manually during Life OS setup). If the link command fails with a
quota error, either request a quota increase on the billing account or unlink an
unused project (candidates: synapse-demo-471205, vertical-karma-471205-j1).

## Task queue (priority order)

### P0 — recovery ✅ DONE 2026-08-01
- [x] Link billing — done (unlinked tafsir-sandbox to free the 3-project quota slot,
      linked tafsir-simplified-6b262; Ahmed approved)
- [x] Verify end-to-end: `/tafsir` 2:255 → 200 cached; 67:2 → 200 fresh generation
      with clean structured JSON. Auth-path endpoints not yet spot-checked from a
      signed-in client — worth one manual smoke test in the browser.

### P1 — do next (high value, low risk)
1. **Lock down unauthenticated destructive/costly endpoints** (backend/app.py) —
   **✅ DEPLOYED & VERIFIED 2026-08-01 (revision tafsir-backend-00258-q55)**:
   without secret → 403 on all 3 cache-mutation routes; debug routes → 404; with
   correct `X-Admin-Secret` → auth passes (400 validation, nothing executed);
   `/tafsir` unaffected. Secret: `admin-secret` v2 in Secret Manager
   (tafsir-simplified), local copy in gitignored `secret/admin-secret.txt`.
   (v1 had a trailing `\r` from Windows openssl — superseded; use v2+.)
   Original finding for the record:
   - `POST /cache/invalidate` (:4058) — anyone can wipe the whole tafsir cache
   - `POST /cache/store` (:3924) — cache poisoning into responses served to all users
   - `POST /cache/prewarm` (:4007) — free LLM spend for anyone
   - `GET /debug/test/<query>` (:7229), `/debug/range-map`, `/debug/verse-metadata` —
     unmetered 65K-token generation + dumps full prompts to logs
   - Suggested: require a shared admin secret header (env `ADMIN_SECRET` via Secret
     Manager) or `@firebase_auth_required` + owner-UID allowlist; return 404 for
     debug routes when env `DEBUG_ROUTES != "1"`.
2. **Fix silent cache poisoning on malformed LLM output** (app.py:7122): the fallback
   dict from `extract_json_from_response` (:3026-3034) is always truthy, so the
   `if not final_json` guard never fires and garbage gets cached forever (memory +
   Firestore). Check `metadata.extraction_error` instead (the `/debug/test` handler
   at :7406 already does this correctly) and return 502 without caching.
3. **Fix guest cache key mismatch** (app.py:7013): `user_profile = get_user_profile(None)`
   returns `{}` for guests, overwriting the guest default profile set at :6849. Result:
   guest cache is written under `practicing_muslim/intermediate` but read under
   `curious_explorer/beginner` → guests never hit cache, every query pays a full LLM
   call, and orphan cache docs pile up in Firestore. Guard: only overwrite when
   `user_id` is truthy.
4. **Gunicorn/Cloud Run timeout mismatch**: gunicorn `--timeout 120` (Dockerfile) <
   worst-case Gemini call w/ retries (app.py:7064-7103). Raise gunicorn to 300 to match
   Cloud Run `--timeout 300`, and cap retries so worst case fits.
5. **Frontend: `res.json()` before `res.ok`** (frontend/app/page.js:1277 vs :1286) —
   users see raw `Unexpected token '<' …` / `Failed to fetch` when backend errors.
   Parse defensively and show one friendly message. Also add a global backend-down
   banner instead of 31 empty catch blocks rendering empty states.

### P2 — planned work
6. **Gemini migration (deadline mid-Oct 2026)**: `gemini-2.5-flash` → `gemini-3.6-flash`,
   and the two hardcoded `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` sites (app.py:8811, :9970) →
   `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` via a new env var. Steps: make -lite sites env-driven; run
   `backend/tests/test_live_pipeline.py` against 3.6-flash; check JSON-format compliance
   & token limits; deploy with env var flip (no code change needed for the main model);
   bump `SCHOLARLY_PIPELINE_VERSION` if response quality/shape shifts.
7. **Dead code purge** (~2,000 backend + ~4,000 frontend lines): `app_optimized.py` tree
   (+ redis/pydantic deps), dead functions listed in the audit §6, frontend
   `AppContext.jsx`, `tafsirApi.{js,ts}`, 20+ orphaned Iman-journal components,
   `/logo-demo`. One PR, pure deletion, no behavior change.
8. **Add `cryptography` to requirements.txt** (imported at app.py:14, currently only a
   transitive dep — a resolver change breaks startup).
9. **Fix Dockerfile PORT** (binds hardcoded 8080, ignores `$PORT`) and consider
   `--workers 2` to use the second CPU.
10. **Frontend build risk**: `useSearchParams()` without a `<Suspense>` boundary
    (app/page.js:877) — breaks/deopts `next build` on Next 15. Wrap it.
11. **Vercel/Capacitor cleanup**: `tafsir-simplified-app.vercel.app` is 404 (dead), but
    `capacitor.config.ts:11` points the iOS shell at it → iOS app is broken. Point it at
    the Cloud Run frontend URL or resurrect the Vercel deploy; remove the dead origin
    from backend CORS (app.py:98) accordingly.
12. **Firestore cache TTL**: `tafsir_cache` has no TTL and no eviction — enable
    Firestore TTL policy on a `expires_at` field or accept unbounded growth.
13. **Observability**: replace emoji `print()` with the configured `logger`; add basic
    request metrics; set up a Cloud Monitoring alert on 4xx/5xx spikes and on Firestore
    PERMISSION_DENIED (this outage went unnoticed in logs for days).
14. **Repo hygiene**: `verse_range_map.json` referenced at app.py:2649 doesn't exist in
    repo (fallback path always taken) — either ship it or delete the load path.

## Session log

### 2026-08-01 (evening) — Claude: P1.1 merged, deployed, verified
- Merged `codex/p1-1-admin-endpoints` → `main` (66db496); pushed all branches.
- Created `admin-secret` in Secret Manager (v2 is the good one; v1 had a trailing
  CR from Windows openssl output), granted accessor to the runtime SA, mounted via
  `--set-secrets` (now also in deploy-backend.sh).
- Built + deployed revisions 00257/00258. Verified live: 403 without secret on
  cache mutation routes, 404 on debug routes, auth passes with secret, `/tafsir`
  2:255 → 200. Cloud Run `--timeout 300` confirmed in the deploy flags.
- NOTE for whoever runs deploys: `deploy-backend.sh` does NOT work from Git Bash on
  this machine (gcloud needs Python; the bash shim hits the MS Store stub). Run the
  `gcloud builds submit` + `gcloud run deploy` steps in PowerShell instead.
- **GPT 5.6: P1.1 is fully closed. Proceed to P1.2** (cache-poisoning guard),
  branch from updated `main`.

### 2026-08-01 — Claude (architect): P1.1 review — APPROVED
- Reviewed `codex/p1-1-admin-endpoints` (bca7bdb, +47 lines app.py only). Verified:
  constant-time compare (`hmac.compare_digest`), fail-closed 503 when `ADMIN_SECRET`
  unset (`logger` confirmed defined at app.py:23), debug routes 404-hidden unless
  `DEBUG_ROUTES=1`, correct decorator order under `@app.route`, all 6 target routes
  covered, read-only cache routes intentionally left public, no response-shape change
  (no pipeline-version bump needed). No changes requested.
- **Changed:** `deploy-backend.sh` — added `--set-secrets "ADMIN_SECRET=admin-secret:latest"`.
- Deploy prerequisites for Ahmed (before merging + deploying this branch):
  1. Create the secret in the infra project (generate a long random value):
     `gcloud secrets create admin-secret --data-file=- --project tafsir-simplified`
  2. Grant the Cloud Run runtime service account access:
     `gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding admin-secret --project tafsir-simplified
      --member serviceAccount:612616741510-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
      --role roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor`
  3. Leave `DEBUG_ROUTES` unset in production.
  Note: deploying WITHOUT the secret is still safe — admin routes fail closed (503).
- GPT 5.6: proceed to P1.2 (cache-poisoning guard), branch from `main` or stack on
  the P1.1 branch if merge is pending — note which in your session entry.

### 2026-08-01 — GPT 5.6: P1.1 admin endpoint lockdown
- Created branch `codex/p1-1-admin-endpoints` from `main`; preserved Claude's existing
  uncommitted `deploy-backend.sh`, `AI.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, and `docs/` work.
- **Changed:** `backend/app.py` — added constant-time `X-Admin-Secret` validation backed
  by `ADMIN_SECRET`; protected `POST /cache/store`, `/cache/prewarm`, and
  `/cache/invalidate`; made all three `/debug/*` routes return 404 unless
  `DEBUG_ROUTES=1`, with the same admin-secret requirement when enabled.
- **Caller compatibility:** no in-repo callers use the six protected routes.
  `/feedback/daily-summary` was deliberately left unchanged and retains its separate
  `X-Cron-Secret` contract. Any external cache-prewarm scheduler must add
  `X-Admin-Secret`.
- **Verified locally without GCP access:** `py -3 -m py_compile backend/app.py` passes;
  an AST-loaded guard harness verified missing server config → 503, missing/wrong
  header → 403, matching header → 200, debug disabled → 404, and all six decorator
  placements. `git diff --check` passes apart from the pre-existing LF/CRLF warning.
- **Untested:** full backend startup and HTTP smoke tests (local dependencies and GCP
  credentials are not configured). Ahmed must create/configure a Secret Manager value
  as Cloud Run env `ADMIN_SECRET`, then manually deploy and run the `AI.md` checklist.
  Leave `DEBUG_ROUTES` unset in production. No `SCHOLARLY_PIPELINE_VERSION` bump: the
  tafsir response shape and pipeline are unchanged.
- **Next:** P1.2 — reject malformed Gemini extraction fallbacks before either cache
  tier is written.

### 2026-08-01 (later) — Claude: outage resolved
- Billing state now: linked = `tafsir-simplified`, `tafsir-simplified-6b262`,
  `life-os-prod-8832`; unlinked = `tafsir-sandbox` (freed the quota slot; was the only
  other linked project — remaining projects were never linked). Sandbox will lose any
  billable resources until relinked; it appeared inactive.
- App verified recovered (cache hit + fresh Gemini generation both 200).

### 2026-08-01 — Claude (architect): takeover audit
- Cloned repo fresh to `c:\Users\us88832\Desktop\tadabbur`; full cloud + code audit.
- Root-caused outage to unlinked billing on `tafsir-simplified-6b262` (Firestore 403s
  since at least 2026-07-29 per Cloud Run logs). Gemini model NOT the cause.
- Verified live: `/health` 200, `/personas` 200, `/daily-verse` 200 (in-memory data),
  `POST /tafsir` → `"Verse not found"` (Firestore-backed), Vercel frontend 404 (dead).
- Confirmed model timeline: 2.5-flash retires 2026-10-16/20; `gemini-3.6-flash` is the
  GA migration target; `gemini-2.0-flash` (old deploy-script pin) already retired.
- **Changed files:** `deploy-backend.sh` (model pin `gemini-2.0-flash` → `gemini-2.5-flash`;
  removed 3 dead vector-search env vars). **Created:** `AI.md`, `HANDOFF.md`,
  `docs/AUDIT-2026-08-01.md`. Nothing committed/pushed yet; nothing redeployed.
